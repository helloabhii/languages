//Creating a First Java Class
public class MyFirstClass { 
//Step 1 
/*
 The name of this Java class is MyFirstClass.
 You need to save this text in a file named MyFirstClass.java.
 A Java class must be saved in a file that has the same name as your class with the extension .java. 
 This is mandatory and is in fact very convenient because you do not need to open a file to know what class is written in it.
 You can give this class any name as long as it does not start with a number
 There is a convention though: the name of a Java class starts with a capital letter.
 This is not mandatory but all Java developers follow this convention. When you become a seasoned Java developer, 
 seeing a class that does not follow this convention will look weird to you.
*/

//step 2
/*
Preparing the Compilation of your First Class
Compiling is the second step you need to follow after the creation of your first class.
It consists of transforming the Java code you wrote in your MyFirstClass.java file into another format that can be executed. 
The result of this transformation will be stored in another file created by the compiler.
The name of this file will be MyFirstClass.class.
